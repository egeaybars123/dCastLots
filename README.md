# dCastLots
This projects aims to provide a new tool for organizations to cast lotteries, such as group lottery for sports teams. 

It will be achieved by using random numbers generated via Chainlink VRF service on Ethereum blockchain. For a single lottery action, one random number will be used,
and hashed with Keccak-256 function with the random number and names of the teams. By this way, predicting which groups the teams belong to will not be possible.
